			<marquee scrollamount = 18> Roblox's description says "Roblox helps power the imaginations of people around the world. As the world's largest social platform for play, over 48 million players come to Roblox every month to create adventures, play games, roleplay, and learn with friends. We call it the "Imagination Platform" and believe everyone should have the right to play on it. That is why Roblox is freely available on all modern smartphones, tablets, desktops, Xbox One, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive."</marquee>
